# Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection

This Code shows the training of a YOLO v8 model architecture from Ultralytics, for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection

## How to get started:
1. ```bash git clone https://github.com/AayudhPanchal/Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection.git```
1. ```bash cd Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection```
1. Download your DataSet and split it into train, test and val folders as in the Notebook.
1. This is how your folder structure should be inside Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection: 
```bash 
├───models
├───test
│   ├───images
│   └───labels
├───train
│   ├───images
│   └───labels
└───val
    ├───images
    └───labels
```
5. Run the Notebook

NOTE: The Dataset used here is not publically available, but make sure the labels are in the format used by YOLO
